Once installed:



1. Create a page called "events" and inside place the `[events]` shortcode. This will list your events.

2. Create a page called "submit event" and inside place the `[submit_event_form]` shortcode if you want front-end submissions.

3. Create a page called "event dashboard" and inside place the `[event_dashboard]` shortcode for logged in users to manage their listings.



**Note when using shortcodes**, if the content looks blown up/spaced out/poorly styled, edit your page and above the visual editor click on the 'text' tab. Then remove any 'pre' or 'code' tags wrapping your shortcode.
